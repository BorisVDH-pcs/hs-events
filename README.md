# HS Battleships

A browser-based platform for High Society clan events: teams complete Old School
RuneScape challenges, submit screenshots as evidence, and the site keeps score
live. It started as a single game, Battleships, and now runs several **game
modes** on the same database, accounts, tile catalogue and admin console.

Every game has a `mode`, picked when the organiser creates it:

| Mode | Teams | In one line |
|---|---|---|
| **Battleships** | exactly 2 | Hidden fleets; every completed tile fires a shot at the enemy board. |
| **Bingo** | any number | One open card for everyone; every tile can be worked at any time, most tiles completed wins. |

More modes are planned. What they share, and how a new one slots in, is in
[docs/multi-game-plan.md](docs/multi-game-plan.md).

## Battleships

Each team secretly places a fleet on its own grid. Players select concealed
positions on the opposing board, complete the associated in-game objective, and
submit evidence to fire at that position.

### Rules and mechanics

- There is no fixed turn order; teams can act whenever they have an available task
  slot.
- Objectives remain concealed until a position is claimed or previewed through an
  earned game mechanic.
- A team can work on only a limited number of claimed objectives at once.
- Completing an objective and submitting the required evidence resolves the shot
  as a hit or miss.
- Ships cannot touch, including diagonally, and their positions are locked when the
  match begins.
- A ship sinks when all of its occupied positions have been hit.
- The first team to sink the opposing fleet wins.
- Match activity and team statistics update live for the players.

## Bingo

A square card, 3×3 up to 10×10, the same for every team. Any number of teams
play it at once.

- The card is revealed when the organiser starts the game. Until then it is
  hidden, so nobody can start working ahead.
- **Every tile is open from the start**, in any order. There is nothing to lock
  in and no limit on how many tiles a team works at once.
- A tile is **completed** by submitting the evidence its completion rule asks for,
  exactly as in Battleships. The first submission on a tile quietly opens it for
  that team, so players never see a claim step.
- **One point per completed tile.** Standings are live, and anyone can look at
  another team's card to see which tiles they have completed (their screenshots
  and part-done progress stay private).
- The game ends when **a team fills the whole card**, or when the **end time**
  passes, whichever comes first. The end time is optional. Without one, the game
  runs until a card is full or the organiser presses *End game now*.
- The winner has the most completed tiles. A tie goes to the team that reached
  its total first. If nobody completed anything, nobody wins.

There is no scheduler behind the timer. From the end time onwards the database
refuses every submission, which fixes the result at that moment. The first open
page whose countdown reaches zero then asks the server to record it
(`bingo_settle`), and every page after that is a no-op.

Line bonuses (a full row or column) are not scored yet. The standings carry each
team's completed tile ids, so adding them later does not need another table.

## Organising

The admin console is the same for every mode. **Games** creates a game and
chooses its mode. **Configure** holds the board builder, teams, roster and
Discord. **Track** shows the live boards and the evidence log. The setup
checklist changes per mode: Battleships needs two teams, captains and placed
fleets, while Bingo needs a full card and at least one player on every team.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Database | Supabase (Postgres) — schema in `supabase/migrations/` |
| Game logic | Postgres `security definer` functions, one migration per change |
| Live updates | Supabase Realtime on `game_events` |
| Frontend | Vite + React |
| Notifications | Discord relay driven off the `game_events` feed |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages, built by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` |

## Why the logic lives in the database

Two things must stay secret from the opposing team: **ship placement** and the
**contents of tiles they have not claimed** (teams pick blind). Putting the rules in
the client would make both reachable. Instead, Row Level Security hides them and
every mutation goes through an RPC that validates server-side — so there is no
request a player can craft to peek or cheat.

Bingo keeps different secrets, through the same mechanism: the whole card until
the game starts, and each team's screenshots and part-done progress always.
`tiles_for_me()` decides what each player can see for both modes. The bingo end
time is enforced in `add_evidence` itself, not by the page's countdown.

## How a tile is finished

Each tile carries a **completion rule** deciding when its evidence is enough.
`claim_is_complete()` in the database is the only authority; `tileProgress.js`
mirrors it so the interface can predict the same answer.

| rule | finishes when |
|---|---|
| `points` | option points reach the target; repeats count |
| `one_set` | any one group is fully collected |
| `each_set` | every group has N **distinct** options |
| `points_per_set` | every group has N points; **repeats count** |
| `value` | the submitter types what each drop was worth, and the total reaches the target |

A `value` tile is typed in **millions** and stored in **tenths** of one, so half a
million is a real submission: `0.5` and `0,5` both work, `0.55` is refused. Every
screen divides back — only the database sees the tenths. See
[docs/tile-fixes-handover.md](docs/tile-fixes-handover.md).

Cutting across all five, a **drop may cap its own repeats**: `tile_options.max_times`
is how many times that one drop may count, and null — every option saved before
the column existed — is unlimited. It lives on the option rather than the rule,
so "2 points, up to four times" and "7 points, once" sit on the same price list.

The builder can **play a tile** before anyone else does: pick a drop, press
**Test submit**, and watch the counter move exactly as a player's card would —
one screenshot at a time, refusals and all, up to the submission that fires the
shot. Each press replays the session through `admin_test_tile()`, which asks the
real `claim_is_complete()` inside a transaction it rolls back, so no claim, no
evidence and no shot survive it. It shows `tileProgress.js`'s answer alongside
the database's, so the two copies of the rules are checked against each other
every time the button is pressed.

A whole board can be **saved under a name and laid down again** — the builder's
*Saved boards* panel. A preset is a snapshot of all hundred squares, stored as
JSONB rather than a third copy of the tile schema, so it survives
`admin_clear_board`, carries repeats and hand-placed one-offs that the random
deal cannot reproduce, and does not change when the catalogue is edited. Loading
one replaces the board, and is refused once a game is past placement or any tile
on it has been claimed.

Two different things are meant by "randomize the board", and the builder now
offers both. **Shuffle** moves the tiles already on the board between the squares
they occupy: the catalogue is never consulted, so no square can come out empty, a
task placed three times stays placed three times, and a one-off typed straight
onto a square survives. **Re-deal** clears the board and draws a new one, which
is the only route to different *tiles* rather than different *places* — but
`admin_autofill_board` uses each catalogue entry at most once, so dealing a
hundred squares from an eighty-six entry label leaves fourteen holes. The dialog
now says how many before you press it.

A square can be **fixed while the game runs**, as long as no team has locked it
in — a wrong drop list spotted in the second hour is no longer unfixable. A
claimed square stays frozen, and not only for fairness: `admin_set_tile`
replaces a tile's drops wholesale and `tile_evidence.option_id` is
`on delete set null`, so editing one mid-progress would silently reset a set
tile's collected evidence to zero. Release the claim first if it really has to
change. Whole-board tools (clear, autofill, load a preset) stay pre-game only.

A **wrong submission can be taken back**, one screenshot at a time — the
*Revoke* button on **Admin → Evidence**. The case it exists for: a team finishes
a tile, picks the wrong drop off the list, and banks the wrong points. Releasing
the claim (below) is too blunt for that — it destroys every other screenshot on
the tile and refuses once the tile has fired — so `admin_revoke_evidence` removes
the one piece and puts the claim back exactly where it stood before it arrived.
The team then resubmits against the right drop.

A revoked tile comes back **unlocked, not handed back**. The claim and every
other screenshot on it survive — nine of ten stays nine of ten, and the task
stays readable on the board — but it holds none of the team's three slots and
takes no more evidence until somebody locks it in again. Without that, a revoke
quietly bought the team a fourth active tile: firing had already freed the slot,
they had spent it elsewhere, and the active-tile limit is a trigger on INSERT
that an un-firing UPDATE walked straight past. Re-locking now costs a slot like
any other claim, and is refused while all three are busy.

Almost nothing about a shot is stored, so most of the rollback is automatic:
scores count fired claims, and a ship is sunk when its cells are hit rather than
because a column says so. What the RPC does by hand is un-fire and park the
claim, take back the free squares revealed around a ship that is no longer sunk,
and reopen a game whose win rested on the shot.

The other team is told **that** a shot was taken back, and nothing else — no
square, no tile name, no drop. That is a deliberate middle: saying nothing is
not the safe option, because a withdrawn shot is already visible to them as a
mark vanishing off their own fleet, and a change with no cause invites exactly
the guessing the secrecy exists to prevent. The full account — tile, square,
drop, counts — goes only to the team it happened to, on their own feed and their
own Discord channel. Locking the tile back in is team-private too, so the enemy
never sees the same coordinate announced twice.

It **refuses nothing** — a hit, a sinking,
and a finished match can all be undone — so every press previews first: the
dialog lists what will happen, and that list is the real function run against
the real rows and rolled back, not a second description of it. A claim that
still meets its target without the revoked piece stays fired, since the team
earned that shot. The submitting team is told on their own feed and Discord
channel.

Boards are assembled in the **board builder** against a reusable tile catalogue.
Details, and the `each_set` / `points_per_set` distinction that is easy to get
wrong, are in [docs/v4-handover.md](docs/v4-handover.md).

## Setup

The migrations in `supabase/migrations/` are applied to the **Battleships**
Supabase project by CI (`supabase db push`) when they reach `main`. Don't apply
them by hand, because that leaves the migration ledger out of step. For a fresh
project, run them in order in the SQL Editor.

```bash
npm install --prefix web
```

Copy `.env.example` to `web/.env` and set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and
`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, then:

```bash
npm run dev --prefix web
```

The dev server runs on **port 5174**, so it can sit alongside HighSocietyScape on 5173.

Two screens can be looked at **without a database**, since the dev server talks
to the live project. `npm run preview:evidence --prefix web` starts a harness on
port 5176 that swaps `lib/supabase.js` for canned data:

- `/preview-evidence.html`: the evidence review and revoke dialog.
- `/preview-bingo.html`: a 5×5 bingo with four teams, from a player's side
  (running, finished, preparation) and the organiser's.

They show what the screens look like. They prove nothing about the SQL.

`npm run test:all --prefix web` runs the self-tests for the pure helpers, bingo
included.

## Deploying

Every push to `main` builds the site and publishes it to
**https://borisvdh-pcs.github.io/HS_Battleships/**.

The Supabase project URL and anon key live in `web/.env.production`, committed on
purpose: Vite inlines them into the bundle, so they are public the moment the site
is served either way. RLS and the security-definer RPCs are what protect the data —
not the secrecy of the anon key. Repo secrets named `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and
`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` override the file if you ever want to rotate the key
without a commit, but none are needed for a working deploy.

> **One-time setting:** GitHub → Settings → Pages → Source must be **"GitHub
> Actions"**, not "Deploy from a branch" — `dist/` is gitignored, so branch mode
> would serve the README instead of the app.

## Sign-in: username only, no email

Players sign in with a **username and password**. There is no email anywhere in
the flow. Supabase Auth keys on email, so the username is mapped to a synthetic
address at `@players.hs-battleships.invalid` that players never see or type
(`web/src/lib/auth.js`). `.invalid` is IANA-reserved, so no mail can ever reach a
real domain.

The trade-off, accepted deliberately: **there is no self-service password reset**,
because there is no mailbox to send a link to. An admin resets a password from
the console instead — **Admin → Accounts**, which lists every player, sets a new
password on the one you pick, and logs who did it. `supabase/admin/player-accounts.sql`
still covers the same job in SQL, plus creating accounts and putting players on
teams.

> **Required setting:** turn **off** Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Email →
> "Confirm email" in the Supabase dashboard. Otherwise Supabase tries to send a
> confirmation to an address that cannot receive one, and sign-ups fail with
> `email rate limit exceeded`. Accounts created through the admin SQL work either
> way, since they set `email_confirmed_at` directly.
