// How far along a claimed tile is, under whichever rule it uses (0049).
//
// One module because three places need the same answer and must not disagree:
// the card's counter, the picker that decides when Submit becomes "Submit &
// fire", and the "?" panel that shows the sets filling up. The database is
// still the authority — claim_is_complete() decides whether a shot actually
// goes off — but the interface has to predict it correctly or the button lies.
//
// The counter half (`have`/`need`/`unit`) is mirrored once more in SQL by
// claim_progress() (20260928120000), which stamps it on evidence events so the
// feed and Discord print what this card prints. Change one, change both.
//
// The rules, mirroring the migration:
//   points         sum the points of what was submitted; repeats count.
//   value          same sum, except the numbers were typed by the submitter.
//   one_set        finished when any ONE group is complete.
//   each_set       finished when EVERY group has `per_set` distinct options.
//   points_per_set finished when EVERY group has `per_set` points in it, and
//                  the same drop handed in twice is worth twice.
//
// An option with no `grp` is its own group, which is what makes "one from each
// of five bosses" and "two different pieces of one set" the same mechanism.
//
// Cutting across all five, an option may carry `max_times`: how often that one
// drop may count. Null is unlimited, which is what every option was before the
// column existed. It belongs to the option rather than the rule, so a capped
// drop closes under `points` exactly as it does under `points_per_set`, and
// the set rules — where a repeat was already worth nothing — are unaffected.
//
// The last two rules are a pair, and the difference between them is the only
// thing either is for: `each_set` is "two DIFFERENT uniques from each boss",
// `points_per_set` is "two uniques from each boss" with no such qualifier. So
// they group identically and diverge on one question — does a repeat count.

 * and hiding it there would leave the reader to infer a price from the absence
 * of a price. So: all the same and that same is one, or nothing is hidden.

 * preview of both — which is exactly why it lives here rather than three times
 * over as a condition each of them gets to word slightly differently.
