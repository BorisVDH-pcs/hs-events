/**
 * Attaching proof to an active tile.
 *
 * Three ways in, because people submit screenshots three ways: drag onto the
 * card, pick a file, or paste. Paste matters most — a fresh screenshot is on
 * the clipboard already, and asking someone to save it to disk first is asking
 * them not to bother. Which tile a Ctrl+V lands on is decided by which card
 * was clicked last — anywhere on the card, not just this zone — tracked by
 * ActiveTiles and shown with a highlight, since a plain focus ring on a small
 * inner box was easy to miss on a board with several active tiles. This
 * component exposes `stageFiles` via ref so the parent can hand it a pasted
 * clipboard image.
 *
 * Dropping a file STAGES it; a second press submits it. That is what makes a
 * remove button possible at all: submitted evidence is immutable by design
 * (tile_evidence has a select policy and nothing else), so the only safe place
 * to change your mind is before it is uploaded. It also means a misdropped
 * screenshot is not permanently attached to the wrong tile.
 *
 * The submit that meets the requirement also fires the shot — there is no
 * separate "mark complete" press, because by then there is nothing left to
 * say. That submit reads differently and asks first, since it is the
 * irreversible one.
 *
 * WHAT A SCREENSHOT HAS TO SAY (0046, 0049). Three of the four tile rules ask
 * the submitter for something beyond the image:
 *
 *   points / set rules — which drop it shows, picked from the tile's list. The
 *     picker is per file rather than per submit because one submit can carry a
 *     rare and a common together, and a single selection for the whole batch
 *     would quietly mis-score exactly the mixed case weighted tiles exist for.
 *     On a set tile the options are grouped by set and anything already handed
 *     in is disabled, so the picker doubles as the checklist of what is left.
 *
 *   value — what the drop was worth, in millions. Used by the tiles that ask
 *     for an amount of GP, where there is no list of drops to pick from.
 *
 * Numbers shown here are for reading, never for scoring. add_evidence looks up
 * what an option is worth server-side and claim_is_complete decides whether the
 * tile is finished; nothing this component computes is trusted by the database.
 *
 * There are deliberately no thumbnails of submitted evidence here. They made
 * the card nearly twice as tall for something a player has already seen; the
 * organiser's review screen is where the images actually need looking at.
