/**
 * A tile's icon, with a stand-in behind it and the coordinate behind that.
 *
 * `slug` is null for any tile this team has not locked in — `tiles_for_me()`
 * redacts it exactly as it redacts the name. That redaction is also why the
 * images cannot leak: with no slug there is no filename, so a tile nobody has
 * produces no request and shows up nowhere in the network log. `standIn` is
 * what separates the two reasons a slug can be missing: a tile nobody locked in
 * has none because it is secret, a locked-in one because nobody drew it yet.
 *
 * Ten of the ninety tiles have artwork so far, so most locked-in tiles would
 * otherwise fall back to a coordinate and look exactly like the untouched ones
 * around them. They borrow the dragon warhammer instead: obviously a
 * placeholder once real art lands beside it, and until then the board reads as
 * a board of items.
 *
 * The coordinate is still the last resort, so a missing icons folder degrades
 * to the grid we had before any artwork existed.
