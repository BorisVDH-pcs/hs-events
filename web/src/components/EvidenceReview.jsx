/**
 * The organiser's read of every piece of evidence in a game.
 *
 * There is no approve or reject here on purpose: uploading is what unlocks the
 * shot, and the game does not stop to wait on a queue mid-event. This exists so
 * that a disputed tile can be settled by looking, and so a team that is inventing
 * completions can be caught. Nothing on this screen is destructive.
 *
 * It names the tile and the team side by side, which is exactly what a player
 * must never see across the line — admin_list_evidence() refuses anyone who is
 * not an admin, so this is gated at the database, not by hiding the component.
 *
 * ---- why it pages, and why it signs a page at a time ----
 *
 * The bucket is private, so every image needs a signed URL, and those expire
 * after an hour. This screen used to mint one for every row in the game the
 * moment it mounted and never mint another — which fails twice over. A game's
 * worth of screenshots is several hundred full-size images rendered at once,
 * and an organiser who leaves the tab open through an event (which is what
 * this tab is for) comes back after the hour to a screen of broken images and
 * no reason given. EvidencePanel had this right for one tile and said so in a
 * comment; this is the same lesson applied to the list.
 *
 * So: the rows are fetched once — the metadata is small and it is what the
 * filters are built from — and only the page on screen is ever signed. Coming
 * back to a stale tab re-signs it.
 *
 * The filters are the other half of the same problem. The screen exists to
 * settle a dispute, and a dispute is about one tile; scrolling a whole event
 * to find it is not reading, it is searching by eye.
 *
 * ---- the one destructive thing on it ----
 *
 * Revoke (20260918163924) is the exception to "nothing on this screen is
 * destructive", and it is here because this is the screen where the mistake is
 * found: the row shows the screenshot next to the drop it was filed as, which
 * is what a mis-pick actually looks like — the right picture against the wrong
 * name.
 *
 * Every press previews first. `admin_revoke_evidence` refuses nothing, so the
 * dialog is the only thing between an organiser and a withdrawn shot, a
 * refloated ship or a reopened game; the preview is that same function run
 * against the real rows and rolled back, so the list it prints is what will
 * happen rather than a second guess at it.
