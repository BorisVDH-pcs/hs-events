/**
 * Building a board by pointing at it.
 *
 * The paste box came from the spreadsheet: a hundred rows already existed as
 * text, and a form would have been a hundred forms. Three events in, the shape
 * of the job has changed — most squares are a task that has been run before,
 * and the work is choosing rather than typing. So this is the other half of the
 * same feature, not a replacement: the paste box still loads a board that
 * exists as text, and this fills one square at a time from the catalogue.
 *
 * Every click is a write. `admin_set_tile` upserts one square, so a half-built
 * board is a real, resumable thing rather than browser state that a closed tab
 * takes with it — which matters when a hundred squares is an evening of work
 * and two organisers might split it.
 *
 * The catalogue is deliberately not scoped to a game. A tile is a task; which
 * board it lands on this time belongs to the square, not to the task.

                It never consults the catalogue, so it cannot leave a square
                empty, it keeps a task that is deliberately placed three
                times, and a one-off typed straight onto a square survives it.
                Nothing it does is recoverable from the catalogue and nothing
                it does needs to be: the hundred tiles coming out are the
                hundred that went in. Hence no dialog -- rearranging is the
                whole of what the button says it does.

                RE-DEAL throws the board away and draws a new one. On a
                hundred-square board from an eighty-six entry label that is
                eighty-six tiles and fourteen holes, because the deal will not
                repeat an entry. Worth having -- it is the only way to

                dialog, which it has.

/**
 * Playing the tile, one screenshot at a time.
 *
 * A tile's rule only says what it means once evidence starts arriving, and the
 * only way to find out used to be to put the square in front of a team — by
 * which point the board is locked.
 *
 * It reads as a play session rather than as a test harness on purpose. The
 * first cut staged a batch and checked it in one go, which answered the
 * question but asked the reader to think in lists: pick, Add, pick, Add, Test.
 * A player does not experience a tile that way. They submit one thing, see the
 * counter move, and submit the next — and the thing worth checking is exactly
 * that experience, including which submission is the one that fires the shot
 * and what the refusal says when a drop has run out.
 *
 * TWO ANSWERS, DELIBERATELY. `admin_test_tile` replays the session through the
 * real `claim_is_complete()` in a transaction it rolls back; `replayTile` runs
 * the same list through `tileProgress.js`. The database is the authority — but
 * the browser's copy of the rules is what draws the player's counter and
 * decides when their button says "Submit & fire", and the two drifting apart
 * is the failure this repo has been one careless edit away from since 0049.
 * When they disagree, that is the headline and nothing else matters.

 * the tile; with no square selected the identical-looking press opened an
 * editor -- and the button beside it swapped between Edit and Delete in the
 * same position, so the one press that cannot be taken back sat exactly where a
 * harmless one had been a moment earlier. Nothing on the row said which list
 * you were looking at: the only cue was a gold ring on a grid that may well
 * have been scrolled off screen.
 *
 * So the mode is a prop, it is said in words above the list, and the second
 * button exists in `place` mode only. Browsing has no secondary button at all
 * -- deleting moved into the form, where the entry it would remove is on screen
 * to be read first. That is what makes the swap impossible rather than merely
 * unlikely: the position that holds Edit while placing holds nothing while
 * browsing.
 *
 * Three modes now rather than two, and the third arrived without argument --
 * which is the point of having done it this way. A list whose meaning is a
 * stated prop can grow a meaning; two hard-coded copies could only have grown
