/**
 * The cannon-fire flourish for a resolved shot. `shot` is `{ nonce, result }`
 * — the nonce changes on every fire so back-to-back shots with the same
 * result still replay instead of no-opping on unchanged state.
 *
 * Sequenced, not simultaneous:
 *   1. The gif plays one round (GIF_DURATION_MS, measured off its own 29
 *      frames) with the cannon-fire sound under it. Nothing else happens.
 *   2. The gif disappears.
 *   3. A short beat of empty board (POST_GIF_PAUSE_MS), then the tile flips
 *      to its hit/miss color and the hit/miss sound plays, both together.
 * Step 3's board flip isn't driven from here — useGame.js delays its
 * tile-reveal refetch by the same REVEAL_DELAY_MS, so it lands in sync with
 * the sound below without the two components needing to talk to each other.
